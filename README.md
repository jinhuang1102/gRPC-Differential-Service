# gRPC-Differential-Service

Creating an open source gRPC based differential service to enable users to differentiate the differences between paired protocol buffer messages. By comparing the user inputs to find the abnormalities that may lead to unexpected behavior of a software system, this service has great potential use cases in debugging, testing, or monitoring software systems. The service is based on gRPC framework and MessageDifferencer libraries.
